## Module03 JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

This challenge requires me to create an application that a user can use to generate a random password based on parameters they have selected. It runs in the browser and is "powered" by JavaScript!

## Usage

Click on the "Generate Password" button, and follow the prompts.

The new password will appear in the text field labeled "Your Secure Password".
